Project Title:
 Comparison between Process and Threads (with 3 Sorting Algorithms)



Introduction:
The motive of our project is comparison between process and threads .we will compare process and threads by using different sorting algorithms.


Methodology:
We will compare this two by using most commonly used sorting algorithms 
1-Selection  Sort
2- Shell Sort
3-Quick Sort 

By implementing the above algorithms, each one with both process and threads, we will differentiate process and threads.
